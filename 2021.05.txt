Data collection and OSIsoft Message Format
OSIsoft Message Format (OMF): to achieve high-throughput asynchronous data collection into the Sequential Data Store. 

Producer: client identity to authenticate and send messages.
OMF topics: aggregate OMF messages received from one or more clients and makes them available for consumption by a subscription.
Subscription: consumes OMF messages from a topic and forwards them to a data store. Multiple subscriptions can retrieve OMF messages from a single topic.

OSIsoft Message Format
https://omf-docs.osisoft.com/
Defines a set of message headers and bodies that can be used to generate messages for ingestion into a compliant back-end system.
OMF can be used to develop data acquisition applications on platforms and in languages for which there are no supported OSIsoft libraries.
OMF itself does not define or depend on any particular binary message protocol (HTTP, AMQP, Kafka, etc.) It is instead based on an abstract message type, where a message consists of a set of key / value pairs, called the headers, and a binary payload, called the body.
OMF messages can thus be constructed using any message protocol that defines headers and bodies.

 “ What we usually consider as impossible are simply engineering problems… there’s no law of physics preventing them. ”
- Michio Kaku (a professor of theoretical physics in the City College of New York and CUNY Graduate Center)
불가능해 보이는 많은 문제들은 실은 공학 문제들이다. 이런 불가능을 해결하는 것을 막는 자연 법칙은 없다. - 미치고 카쿠
